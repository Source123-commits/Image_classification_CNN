# Image_classification_CNN
This project aims to build an image classification system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with Transfer Learning, specifically leveraging the VGG16 architecture, to classify images into four custom categories: bike, cats, horses, and human.

The dataset used for this task is a manually created and organized folder-based image collection containing 975 images divided among the four classes. Each class has a varying number of samples, and all images are preprocessed to fit the input shape required by the VGG16 model (224x224 pixels).

Transfer Learning allows us to reuse the knowledge of a pre-trained model (VGG16 trained on ImageNet) and fine-tune it for our specific classification task. This significantly reduces training time and improves accuracy even with a smaller dataset.

The model achieved high accuracy (about 90%) after a few epochs of training, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning in small custom datasets.
